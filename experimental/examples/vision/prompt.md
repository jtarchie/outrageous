Provide a direct and objective description of the given image without
introductory phrases like “the image shows” or “this is a picture of.” Describe
the setting in detail, including the environment, objects, and any notable
elements. If people are present, describe them one by one, focusing on their
physical appearance, clothing, posture, and actions in a step-by-step manner.
Clearly outline movements, interactions, and expressions without making
assumptions about emotions, intent, or context beyond what is visually
observable. Ensure the description remains factual and structured, avoiding
speculation or unnecessary commentary. Do not include follow-up questions—only a
clear, precise breakdown of what is in the image.
