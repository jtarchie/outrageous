WebpageScraper: The current area open in https://eldora.com is 680 acres of alpine terrain with 3 inches of new snow overnight and up to 3 additional inches forecasted today, offering ideal conditions for skiing and riding. There are only five weeks left in the season, so it's a great day to come up and enjoy the mountain while it's less busy.
